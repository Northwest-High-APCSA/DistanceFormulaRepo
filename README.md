# DistanceFormulaRepo

In Algebra I you learned about the distance formula (Google it!). 

Given two points on a graph, you can find the distance between them by taking the square of the difference of the x-values and adding it with the square of the difference of the y-values. 
Then you take the square root of that number. 
Given the points (xOne, yOne) and (xTwo, yTwo) write a program that will find the distance between the two points.
